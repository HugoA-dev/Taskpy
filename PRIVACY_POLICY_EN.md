## Taskpy Privacy Policy (English)
Effective Date: July 25, 2025

Thank you for using Taskpy. Your privacy is our top priority. This Privacy Policy explains what information the app stores and how it is used. Our fundamental principle is that your data is yours. Taskpy is designed to be a private space, and your information stays on your device.

## 1. Information We Store
Taskpy is designed to run entirely locally on your device. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to our own servers because we do not operate any.

The information the app saves is stored exclusively on your device and falls into two categories:

a) Data You Provide Directly

Username: The name you enter on the welcome screen is saved on your device to personalize the home screen.

Task Data: Any task you create, including its title, description, due date, priority, and status (pending/completed), is stored in the app's local database on your device.

b) App Configuration Data

Theme Preferences: Your choice between light or dark mode and your selected accent color are saved locally.

Biometric Lock Settings: The decision to enable or disable fingerprint/Face ID lock is securely stored on your device.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
We use the information stored on your device only for the following purposes:

To provide the app's core functionality: Display, manage, and organize your tasks.

To personalize your experience: Greet you by name and apply your chosen theme.

To send reminders: The app uses your task due dates to schedule local notifications on your device. These notifications are managed by your phone's operating system and do not send any information to us.

To save your settings: Remember your theme and security preferences across app sessions.

All your information is processed and stored exclusively on your device. We do not have access to your tasks or your personal information.

## 3. Data Storage and Security
All information is stored in the app's private and secure storage, managed by your operating system (Android). We use standard security measures provided by the Flutter platform and the mobile operating system to protect locally stored data.

The "Export Tasks" feature allows you to create a backup of your data in a .json file. This file is created on your device, and you have full control over it. The security of this exported file is your responsibility once you share or save it outside of the app.

## 4. Information Sharing
We do not share, sell, or rent your personal information with third parties, as we do not collect it.

## 5. Children's Privacy
Our app is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children.

## 6. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We recommend that you review this page periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
